a cursorless text editor


llwe is a text editor in the terminal.  llwe is for you if you like your
editor to start up quickly, don't care for frills and extensions, and
want to try a very different method for controlling your text editor.
If you dig the extensibility of emacs or have more than 10 lines in
your .vimrc then you may enjoy trying out llwe but probably won't find
it useful for day to day use.

Learning llwe shouldn't be too difficult if you're coming from vim,
since you'll already be familiar with modal editing.  No matter what
editor you currently use, simplicity is an important goal of llwe so
there should be relatively few commands to learn.  The reward for your
efforts is an editor that encourages flow by allowing you to quickly
change anything you can see.  See below for details on how this works.
Or compile the code and get editing!

Compiling / Installing

You should be able to simply clone the git repository and run make.
If that gives you errors about missing curses headers, you may need to
install libncurses-dev (or the equivalent for your system).

To install you can copy the llwe executable to a location in your $PATH.
I usually have ~/bin in my path so I copy it to ~/bin/llwe.

	$ git clone https://github.com/TheTomster/llwe
	$ cd llwe
	$ make
	$ cp ./llwe ~/bin/llwe


First steps

	$ llwe foo

This command will open llwe editing file foo.  If foo doesn't exist,
an empty buffer will be opened, and the first time you write it will
create foo.

To start writing in an empty file, press `i` and start typing.  You should
see your text appear.  When it starts up, llwe is in COMMAND mode.
In this default mode it interprets your keypresses as commands to run.
Pressing lowercase i while in COMMAND mode will switch to INSERT mode.
In INSERT mode, your keypresses will insert text into the buffer, just
like notepad or nano.

Press escape or control-d to exit INSERT mode.  The last line of the
screen displays some status information, including what mode you're in.
It also tells the name of the file you are currently editing, as well
as what line you are scrolled to.

	[F: filename    ][M: mode    ][L: scroll pos]

If you've been following along, the status line should show that you're
in COMMAND mode.  Now you can press w (lowercase) to save the file.
There's no indication of a successful write, only an error on failure :-).
Finally, you can press q to quit.

Let's reopen the file to make sure that llwe is working, and to try out
this "cursorless editing" thing.  If there's already text in the buffer,
you'll notice that pressing i doesn't take you straight to INSERT mode.
Instead you get something called TARGET mode.  Since there's no cursor,
specifying where to act on the text is a separate step.  Inserts and
appends add text before or after the target you select.  Once you've
selected a location, llwe switches to INSERT mode.  The change and
delete commands do targeting twice, to pick a start and end point.
Everything between the points will be removed, and you'll be put into
INSERT or COMMAND mode depending on whether you did a change or delete.

Lowercase commands tend to operate on single letters. Uppercase commands
tend to operate on lines.  Experiment with i, I, d, and D to get an idea
of how the targeting works.

Refer to the quick command list above to get an idea of what other
commands are available to you.


Cursorless editing

In a typical screen-oriented text editor, a cursor is used to indicate
where editing operations will happen.  In llwe, there is no cursor.
Instead, each operation waits for a target.  For example, to insert text
you would type 'i' for insert, and then specify a location to insert
the text.  Typing a letter that appears on screen will start inserting
text at that letter.  Frequently there is more than one matching letter
on screen.  llwe will highlight all of the matches and label them a-z,
to allow you to choose which one you intended.  If there are a lot of
matches, it might take more than one layer of relabeling to specify the
correct one.  More than 2 layers is relatively rare, since you would
need more than 600 of the same letter on your screen to require a third
layer of disambiguation.

This is difficult to explain in words, but I think it's intuitive after
a little experimentation.  Instead of navigating the cursor around
constantly, you can locate where you wish to edit with your eyes.
Then simply press the letter you're insterested in, and keep pressing
the letters that pop up until the targeting is done.
